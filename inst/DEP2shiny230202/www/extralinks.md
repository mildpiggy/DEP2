## Welcome to Extra Links!

### Here we listed some links for convenience :
- [`GeneCards`](https://www.genecards.org/) is a searchable, integrative database that provides comprehensive, user-friendly information on all annotated and predicted human genes. The knowledgebase automatically integrates gene-centric data from ~150 web sources, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, genetic, clinical and functional information
</br>
</br>
- [`UniProt`](https://www.uniprot.org/) (The Universal Protein Resource) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data
</br>
</br>
- [`PubMed`](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) links to the interface of pubmed
</br>
</br>
- [`HPA`](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) (The Human Protein Atlas) is a Swedish-based program initiated in 2003 with the aim to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues and organs using an integration of various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics and systems biology
</br>
</br>
- [`UALCAN`](http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html) is a comprehensive, user-friendly, and interactive web resource for analyzing cancer OMICS data. It is built on PERL-CGI with high quality graphics using javascript and CSS. UALCAN is designed to, a) provide easy access to publicly available cancer OMICS data (TCGA, MET500 and CPTAC), b) allow users to identify biomarkers or to perform in silico validation of potential genes of interest, c) provide graphs and plots depicting expression profile and patient survival information for protein-coding, miRNA-coding and lincRNA-coding genes, d) evaluate epigenetic regulation of gene expression by promoter methylation, e) perform pan-cancer gene expression analysis, and f) Provide additional information about the selected genes/targets by linking to HPRD, GeneCards, Pubmed, TargetScan, The human protein atlas, DRUGBANK, Open Targets and the GTEx
</br>
</br>
- [`GEPIA`](http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) is a newly developed interactive web server for analyzing the RNA sequencing expression data of 9,736 tumors and 8,587 normal samples from the TCGA and the GTEx projects, using a standard processing pipeline. It provides customizable functions such as tumor/normal differential expression analysis, profiling according to cancer types or pathological stages, patient survival analysis, similar gene detection, correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction analysis
</br>
</br>
- [`cBioPortal`](http://www.cbioportal.org/) for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets
